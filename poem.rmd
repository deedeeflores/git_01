## First Verse 
<!--Put the first five lines of a poem by Lewis Carrol in this section!-->

Five little girls, of Five, Four, Three, Two, One:      
Rolling on the hearthrug, full of tricks and fun.     

Five rosy girls, in years from Ten to Six:     
Sitting down to lessons - no more time for tricks.     

Five growing girls, from Fifteen to Eleven:      
Music, Drawing, Languages, and food enough for seven!

In gardens fair, where blossoms bloom,      
There dances free a splendid plume,       
A creature delicate and bright,        
A symbol of pure joy and light.        

With wings adorned in vivid hues,      
A ballet in the air they choose,        
A dance of grace, so light and free,        
A sight that fills our hearts with glee.         

From caterpillar to the sky,        
A transformation, none can deny,         
Metamorphosis, a wondrous thing,         
A miracle that life can bring.          

Their flight, a whisper through the air,       
A symphony of colors rare,      
A gentle flutter, soft and sweet,        
Their beauty, a divine retreat.        

In sun-kissed meadows, they alight,       
With petals soft, they find delight,         
They sip the nectar from the flowers,          
A love that blooms through fleeting hours.          

Their journey brief, but full of zest,            
A symbol of life's transient quest,              
To remind us all, each passing day,                
To cherish moments, come what may.             

So when you see a butterfly,              
In gardens bright or skies up high,           
Pause for a moment, and you'll see,              
Life's precious dance and its decree.
